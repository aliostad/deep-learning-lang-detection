function Install-MsmqMessageQueue
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Installs an MSMQ queue.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new queue with name `Name`.  If a queue with that name already exists, it is deleted, and a new queue is created. 

    If the queue needs to be private, pass the `Private` switch.  If it needs to be transactional, set the `Transactional` switch.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Install-MsmqMessageQueue -Name MovieQueue

    Installs a public, non-transactional `MovieQueue`.

    .EXAMPLE
    Install-MsmqMessageQueue -Name CriticsQueue -Private -Transactional

    Installs a private, transactional `CriticsQueue` queue.
