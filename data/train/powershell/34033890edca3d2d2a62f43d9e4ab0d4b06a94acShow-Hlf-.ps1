.Synopsis
	Shows .hlf help file.
	Author: Roman Kuzmin

.Description
	It is similar to the plugin HlfViewer.

	"What's it for if there is HlfViewer?" Well, originally it was created to
	test IFar.ShowHelp(). Then, as far as it is created, why not to use it?
	Besides, this way is perhaps more flexible.

.Parameter FileName
		Help file path; if none then a file is taken from the editor.

.Parameter Topic
		Help topic in a file.

.Example
	# Show Far help
	Show-Hlf- "$env:FARHOME\FarEng.hlf"

	# Show PowerShellFar help topic Cmdlets
	Show-Hlf- "$($Psf.AppHome)\PowerShellFar.hlf" Cmdlets

.Link

	(this is for demo, a better way is to use the menu and a macro).

	return

# commit
$editor.Save()

# open a file from editor with the current topic

		$Topic = $matches[1]
		break
	}
}
$Far.ShowHelp($editor.FileName, $Topic, 'File')
