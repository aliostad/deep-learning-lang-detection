/// Hopac is a library for F# with the aim of making it easier to write correct,
/// modular and efficient parallel, asynchronous and concurrent programs.  The
/// design of Hopac draws inspiration from languages such as Concurrent ML and
/// Cilk.  Similar to Concurrent ML, Hopac provides message passing primitives
/// and supports the construction of first-class synchronous abstractions.
/// Parallel jobs (lightweight threads) in Hopac are created using techniques
/// similar to the F# Async framework.  Hopac runs parallel jobs using a work
/// distributing scheduler in a non-preemptive fashion.
///
/// Before you begin using Hopac, make sure that you have configured your F#
/// interactive and your application to use server garbage collection.  By
/// default, .Net uses single-threaded workstation garbage collection, which
/// makes it impossible for parallel programs to scale.
///
/// The documentation of many of the primitives contains a reference
/// implementation.  In most cases, actual implementations are optimized by
/// taking advantage of internal implementation details and may be significantly
/// faster than the reference implementation.  The reference implementations are
/// given for a number of reasons.  First of all, they hopefully help to better
/// understand the semantics of the primitives.  In some cases, the reference
/// implementations also demonstrate how you can interface Hopac with other
/// systems without the need to extend the primitives of Hopac.  The reference
/// implementations can also be seen as examples of how various primitives can
/// be used to implement more complex operations.
///
/// As can quickly be observed, the various primitives and modules of Hopac are
/// named and structured using a number of patterns.
///
/// Many modules contain a module named `Global`, which contains operations
/// bound to the global scheduler that is implicitly managed by the Hopac
/// library.  The global scheduler is created when an operation, such as
/// `Job.Global.run`, requires it.  If a program never uses an operation that
/// requires the global scheduler, then no global scheduler will be created.
/// This allows programs to be written that explicitly manage their own local
/// schedulers.
///
/// Modules for various communication primitives contain a module named `Now`,
/// which contains operations that can be efficiently performed as
/// non-concurrent operations.  For example, there is a concurrent `Ch.create`
/// operation, which needs to be run to create a new channel and also a
/// `Ch.Now.create` function that directly creates a new channel.  In cases
/// where such efficient non-concurrent functions are provided, you should
/// prefer to use them, because they avoid the overhead of running concurrent
/// operations.  However, in cases where operations really need to perform
/// concurrent operations, such as starting a concurrent server, you should
/// prefer not to encapsulate those operations as ordinary functions, because
/// running individual concurrent operations via some scheduler incurs overheads
/// and it is preferable to construct longer sequences of concurrent operations
/// to run.
///
/// For some infix operators there are both `Job` and `Alt` level versions.  The
/// `Alt` level versions end with a question mark `?` that indicates the
/// selective nature of the operation.
///
/// Some higher-order operations make sense to use with both non-concurrent user
/// defined functions and with user defined concurrent jobs and in such cases
/// there are often two versions of the higher-order functions, with one having
/// the suffix `Fun` and the other having the suffix `Job`.  You should prefer
/// the `Job` version when you need to perform concurrent operations and
/// otherwise the `Fun` version.

/// Embedded jobs can be useful when defining computations built upon jobs.
/// Having to encode lightweight threads using the job monad is somewhat
/// unfortunate, because it is such a fundamental abstraction.  One sometimes,
/// perhaps even often, wants to define more interesting computations upon jobs,
/// but the traditional way of doing that requires adding yet another costly
/// layer of abstraction on top of jobs.  Another possibility is to expose the
/// `Job<'x>` type constructor as shown in the following example:
///
///> type Monad<'x>
///
///> type MonadBuilder =
///>   member Delay: unit -> Job<Monad<'x>>
///>   member Return: 'x -> Job<Monad<'x>>
///>   member Bind: Job<Monad<'x>> * ('x -> Job<Monad<'y>>) -> Job<Monad<'y>>
///>   member Bind: EmbeddedJob<'x> * ('x -> Job<Monad<'y>>) -> Job<Monad<'y>>
///
/// The `Monad<'x>` type constructor and the `MonadBuilder` defines the new
/// computation mechanism on top of jobs.  The `Bind` operation taking an
/// `EmbeddedJob<'x>` allows one to conveniently embed arbitrary jobs within the
/// computations without introducing nasty overload resolution problems.
///
/// Consider what would happen if one would instead define `MonadBuilder` as
/// follows:
///
///> type MonadBuilder =
///>   member Delay: unit -> Job<Monad<'x>>
///>   member Return: 'x -> Job<Monad<'x>>
///>   member Bind: Job<Monad<'x>> * ('x -> Job<Monad<'y>>) -> Job<Monad<'y>>
///>   member Bind: Job<      'x > * ('x -> Job<Monad<'y>>) -> Job<Monad<'y>>
///
/// A `Bind` operation is now almost always ambiguous and one would have to
/// annotate bind expressions to resolve the ambiguity.
///
/// The types of the operations in the `MonadBuilder` may, at first glance, seem
/// complicated.  Essentially the covariant positions in the signature are
/// wrapped with the `Job<_>` type constructor to make it possible to use
/// lightweight threads.  In a language with built-in lightweight threads this

/// Represents a first-class selective synchronous operation.
///
/// The inspiration for alternatives comes from the events of Concurrent ML.
/// The term ''alternative'' was chosen, because the term ''event'' is already
/// widely used in .Net.
///
/// Simpler forms of selective synchronization exists in various languages.  For
/// example, the occam language has an `alt` statement, the Go language has a
/// `select` statement and Clojure's core.async has an `alt` function.  In Hopac
/// and Concurrent ML, selective synchronous operations are not limited to
/// primitive message passing operations (see `Ch.give` and `Ch.take`), but are
/// instead first-class values (see `choose`) and can be extended with
/// user-defined code (see `wrap` and `withNack`) allowing the encapsulation of
/// concurrent protocols as selective synchronous operations.
///
/// The idea of alternatives is to allow one to introduce new selective
/// synchronous operations to be used with non-determinic choice aka `choose`.
/// Obviously, when you have a concurrent server that responds to some protocol,
/// you don't have to perform the protocol as a selective synchronous operation.
/// However, if you do encapsulate the protocol as a selective synchronous
/// operation, you can then combine the operation with other selective
/// synchronous operations.  That is the essence of Hopac and CML.
///
/// If a selective synchronous operation is not committed to then it should have
/// essentially no effect.  In order to create such alternatives, one may take
/// advantage of idempotency, rendezvous and negative acknowledgments.  Here are
/// few rules of thumb:
///
/// - If you don't need to send arguments to the server, you can synchronize
/// using a `take` operation on the server's reply channel.  E.g. an operation
/// to take an element from a concurrent buffer.
///
/// - If you don't need a result from the server, aside from acknowledgment that
/// the operation has been performed, you can synchronize using a `give`
/// operation on the server's request channel.  E.g. an operation to remove a
/// specified element from a concurrent bag.
///
/// - If you have an idempotent operation, you can use `guard` to send the
/// arguments and a write once variable to the server and then synchronize using
/// a `read` operation on the write once variable for the reply.  E.g. request
/// to receive a timeout event.
///
/// - If you have a non-idempotent operation, you can use `withNack` to send the
/// arguments, negative acknowledgment token and a channel to the server and
/// then synchronize using a `take` operation on the channel for the reply.  See
/// `withNack` for an illustrative toy example.
///
/// Note that `Alt` is a subtype of `Job`.  You can use an alternative in any
/// context that requires a job.

///
/// You can use serialized variables to serialize access to a specific piece of
/// shared state.  The idea is that one and only one concurrent job has access
/// to that state at any one time.  This way access to the shared state is
/// entirely serialized.
///
/// WARNING: Unfortunately, `MVar`s are easy to use unsafely.  Do not use an
/// `MVar` to pass information from a client to a server, for example.  Use a
/// `Ch` or `Mailbox` for that.  Note that if you are familiar with the `MVar`
/// abstraction provided by Concurrent Haskell, then it is important to realize
/// that the semantics and intended usage of Hopac's and Concurrent ML's `MVar`
/// are quite different.  The `MVar` of Concurrent Haskell is a bit like a
/// simplified `Ch` with a buffer of one element and some additional operations.
/// The `MVar` of Hopac and Concurrent ML does not allow usage as a kind of
/// buffered channel.
///
/// A serialized variable can be either empty or full.  When a job makes an
/// attempt to take the value of an empty variable, the job is suspended until
/// some other job fills the variable with a value.  At any one time there
/// should only be at most one job that holds the state to be written to a
/// serialized variable.  Indeed, the idea is that access to that state is
/// serialized.  If this cannot be guaranteed, in other words, there might be
/// two or more jobs trying to fill a serialized variable, then you should not
/// be using serialized variables.
///
/// Another way to put it is that serialized variables are designed to be used
/// in such a way that the variable acts as a mechanism for passing a permission
/// token, the value contained by the variable, from one concurrent job to
/// another.  Only the concurrent job that holds the token is allowed to fill
/// the variable.  When used in this way, operations on the variable appear as
/// atomic and access to the state will be serialized.
///
/// In general, aside from a possible initial `fill` operation, an access to a
/// serialized variable should be of the form `take >>= ... fill` or of the form
/// `read`.  On the other hand, accesses of the form `fill` and `read >>=
/// ... fill` are unsafe.  A `take` operation effectively grants permission to
/// the job to access the shared state.  The `fill` operation then gives that
/// permission to the next job that wants to access the shared state.
///
/// Here is an implementation of a synchronization object similar to the .Net
/// `AutoResetEvent` using serialized variables:
///
///> type AutoResetEvent (init: bool) =
///>   let set = if init then mvarFull () else mvar ()
///>   let unset = if init then mvar () else mvarFull ()
///>   member this.Set = unset <|>? set >>= MVar.fill set
///>   member this.Wait = set >>=? MVar.fill unset
///

/// synchronization object.  At most one of the variables, representing the
/// state of the synchronization object, is full at any time.
