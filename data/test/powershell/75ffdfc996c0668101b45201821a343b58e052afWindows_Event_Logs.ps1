# To see a list logs that begin with "s" on the computer named "localhost":

get-winevent -listlog s* -computername "localhost"



# To see the details of just the Security log:

get-winevent -listlog security | format-list *



# To show the last 20 events from the System log:

get-winevent -logname system -maxevents 20

$events += get-winevent -logname security    -maxevents 20
