Way #10: Event sourcing -- Building state from a list of past events

In this design, the client sends a `Command` to a `CommandHandler`.
The CommandHandler converts that to a list of events and stores them in an `EventStore`.

In order to know how to process a Command, the CommandHandler builds the current state
from scratch using the past events associated with that particular turtle.

Neither the client nor the command handler needs to track state.  Only the EventStore is mutable.
