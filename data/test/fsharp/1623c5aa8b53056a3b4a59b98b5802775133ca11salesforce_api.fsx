SOQL
====

Salesforce provides a REST API helping you to download and upload data in the CRM.

Searching entities is really easy with their SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language).

See. https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select.htm

Customized Salesforce models
============================

The CRM can be configured to cutomize your model.
You can add fields adapted to your activities.

LINQ provider
=============

Existing .Net api simply give possibility to send strings containing your SOQL.

Then it was really frustrating not to have Linq provider :)

So this project provides a LINQ to SOQL and a code generator to scaffold your entities
