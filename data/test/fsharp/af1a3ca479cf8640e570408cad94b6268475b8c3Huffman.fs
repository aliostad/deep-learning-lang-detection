    (*Pattern Matching 
Pattern matching is one of the basic but very powerful features of F#.  Using pattern matching allows code to be succinct while at the same time very clear about it's behaviour.  Just about every function in the code above uses pattern matching - which is typical of a lot of F# code.  

In simple cases, such as in "huffmanCodes" above, pattern matching makes it easy to switch on the possible cases of a union datastructure.  

match tree with
| Leaf (c,_) -> //...
| Node (_, left, right) -> //...In more complex cases like "decodeInner" above, pattern matching helps to guide your code. You list each shape of input that you know how to handle, and the leaf nodes of the pattern you matched indicate the data needed to define the behaviour of that case.  Then the compiler kindly tells you which cases you haven't covered. When I wrote this function originally, I was missing the first case, and got this helpful compiler warning:

Warning: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression. The value '([],Node (_, _, _))' will not be matched Which was exactly right - this particular input indicates that the user provided illegal inputs!

 

Pipelining
Pipelining is a nice way to declaratively describe a series of operations to perform on an input.  It's philosophically just like pipelining in a command shell - take the input data from the left and pass it as input to the function on the right.  

Because the F# libraries provide a good collection of primitive operations to perform on your data, it's easy to describe a transformation as a pipeline of data through a sequence of these operations.  For example, you can filter, project, collapse, zip, and re-package data easily and declaratively.

 

Collections
The code uses the 4 common F#/.NET collections:

F# "List": Immutable linked list used for recursive algorithms which walk across a list 
F# "Map": Immutable dictionary used to store the codes for each symbols 
F# "Seq" = .NET "IEnumerable":  Primitive collection interface, used for the inputs 
.NET "Array": Basic typed arrays used as the output of the encoding 
Note that it is easy and common to switch between these collections as needed, using functions like "List.to_array" and "Map.of_list".

 

"It's a .NET component!" a.k.a. "The Slickness"
When I wrote this code, I started out in "experimentation" mode. I just wrote a bunch of small functions at the top level and used F# Interactive to execute them as I went. But once I had something that seemed to work, I wanted to wrap it up in a class that could encapsulate all the functionality, and provide a nice .NET interface. Here's what I did:

Tab everything in one level
Wrap the code in:


type HuffmanCoder(symbols : seq<char>, frequencies : seq<float>) =         // All the code goes here...        member coder.Encode source = encode source    member coder.Decode source = decode sourceI can't really understate how amazing this is.  In F#, it is super-simple to smoothly transition from experimentation coding to component design coding.  This is something that F# can manage because it is a hybrid functional/OO language intergated carefully into .NET.  And because of this, it is really easy to build components of a larger .NET system in F#.  I heard this referred to once as "the slickness" of functional OO coding in F#, and I like that term, because whenever I do this it just feels so slick. :-)

In case you are curious, here's what it looks like from C#:

    public class HuffmanCoder
    {
        public HuffmanCoder(IEnumerable<char> symbols, IEnumerable<double> frequencies);

        public string Decode(bool[] source);
        public bool[] Encode(string source);
    }*)
