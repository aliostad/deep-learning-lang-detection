;##Overview
;sim.engine contains the higher-level operations that define a discrete event simulation.  It acts 
;as a harness around the simulation context, and guides the flow of control 
;throughout the simulation.  At a high level of abstraction, the engine is a 
;process that coordinates one or more concurrent processes to calculate 
;new simulation contexts from prior simulation contexts.  
;From a functional perspecive, the engine defines an ordered composition of 
;simpler transfer functions - or systems - that, when applied to a initial
;context, returns a new simulation context.  

;When performed repeatedly, feeding preceding simulation contexts into
;the transfer function, a recurrence relation between previous contexts and 
;future contexts emerges.  The result is effectively a snapshot of simulation 
;contexts, which are computed via a simple transfer function, __sim-step__,  
;which simulates multiple domains relevant to the defined simulation.  

;Thus, the engine serves as the causal backbone, and coordinating mechansim, 
;for every bit of logic executed during the course of the simulation. The 
;primary function, __event-step-marathon__, prescribes the order of application 
;;of each logical subsystem.

;Initialization consists of 3 tasks:    
;1. Prep the system for day 0  
;2. Adjust the context so that it defines a finite time horizon for simulation.
;   The last  day of the simulation is determined either by passing in value, 
;   or by allowing the context to derive its own last day dynamically.  
;3. Tell observers to sync themselves to the simulation state.  Some observers 
;   need access to the specific elements of the state.  This makes it easy 
;   (and indirect) to advertise the state, and to allow the observers to link 
;   to it as needed. Observers/watchers will need to be expanded on, since 
;   watches will involve effects.

;##Simulation Termination Logic
;When we exit the simulation, we typically want to perform some final tasks.
;For instance, any resources (for logging, display, etc.) may need to be freed.
;The default mechanism for this is to propogate some events through the context

;of time with some processing.  This notion could be abstracted into a higher 
;order function to wrap the simulation, along with the aforementioned begin-day

;##Primary Simulation Logic
;We enter the main engine of the Marathon simulation, which implements a 
;single-threaded, discrete event simulation by default.


;The simulation is technically a discrete event simulation, although it's 
;relatively "coarse-grained" in that, rather than having a ton of fine-grained 
;events on the queue, we only really enqueue "eventful" times.  The simulation
;step function is written as a high-level process, that is intended to be 
;invoked on every eventful day (every time on the simulation context's agenda).
;We primarily use the event system to communicate changes, and to notify 
;- potentially effectful - observers that could be logging, updating displays,
;or doing other things.  Internal simulation workings are handled in a fairly 
;bulk or batch manner by the coarse functions that comprise the step function.

;The end result is that control flow is fairly simple: we only really have 
;pending "times" to evaluate the step function against, rather than a slew of 
;smallish events to trace.  In a sense, it is very similar to the "game loop" 
;or simulation loop of time-step simulations, except for the ability to vary the
;time intervals.  Also, we retain the flexibility to push more fine-grained 
;events onto the queue if we need to.  It's the best of both worlds.  

;We want to ensure that there is an enabled supply and /or 
;demand that will actually provide some meaningful simulation output.  If not, 
;we should warn the user about missing data leading to the absence of "stuff"
;to simulate.

;#State Transition Function#
;We simulate each eventful day using a composition of simulation systems in 
;Marathon.  Each system acts in turn, computing updates to pieces of the overall
;simulation state.  Some systems communicate with eachother via events.  
;All systems have access to the entire simulation context, including the event 
;queue, for communication purposes.

;;In one sense, this defines higher-order behavior for a simulation
;;entity....
;;It handles steps by trying to achieve each of the steps in turn,
;;as with a [seq] behavior.  Another, less-structured way of looking
;;at this is that we are trying to get the system into a consistent
;;state by the end of the day.  In order to achieve consistency,
;;we can have no further pending events for the day.  So, distributing
;;the responsibilities by system is perhaps less meaningful if we're using
;;a kind of actor context.  One way we could partition these responsibilities
;;is to have each store implement its own messaging system.  For example, managing
;;the supply means allowing entities under the supply's purvue to process
;;updates for the day.
(defn sim-step
  "Primary state transition function for Marathon.  Threads the next day and

;;in ECS parlance, the functions in sim-step are just systems.
;;Each of these systems operates on the ECS, or more specifically,
;;the components within the ECS that are of interest, and
;;then narrowly computes the new components for the system from
;;the inputs.  We have composition of system by applying them
;;in-order to the input ECS; however, it's entirely possible that
;;we could define different means of composition, namely parallel
;;composition and the like, to allow the system execution to
;;run any way we'd like.
;;Since systems are just functions, we can build them up from smaller
;;systems (functions) and layer the behavior.
;;This is right and proper and functional;

;;Thinking of systems as vertical (in the sense of operating on columns of components),
;;we can think of single-purpose systems the operate on broad-swaths of components
;;-namely on an entity-by-entity basis- like messaging and behaviors - as
;;horizontal systems.  Horizontal systems may act at sporadic times, and
;;across many components (for instance at the entity level rather than
;;at the component level);   If we have an abstract entity that is
;;able to receive messages, its behavior is dictated by some system.
;;This system will be called as a function of events;  we'd like the
;;convenience of "triggering" events now or later.  One type of apparent
;;event that gets called quite a bit is the "behavior" or update event,
;;which we currently implement as handling a message.  We can let
;;the entity handle the message in any number of ways, but this means
;;we have an ambient system that can be invoked concurrently with
;;any currently running system (or really, we can queue it for invokation).
;;Do we really need to use messaging, or can we just apply the behavior
;;system on ad-hoc basis?   I think we can go adhoc, and just allow
;;other systems to have access to the behavior system if they need it.
;;For now, we can just do everything synchronously and not worry about
;;scaling it via messaging.  Alternately, we can queue the messages/events
;;and have them handled in-between system calls (part of binding the system)
;;Before and afte running any system, we maybe handle pending messages.
;;Either that, or we deal with messages in-line.  Either way, it works out and
;;can be handled synchronously.
