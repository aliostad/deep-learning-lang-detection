/* TIME TO EDIT THE HTML 

   1) Open shulman.html, find the reference in the javascript to 
      '#SOMEDIV', and change it to '#main'. 
      Check to see that the slideshow now works with your buttons 
 
   2) Work out what is connecting your buttons to the slideshow functions -- 
     then find a way to make clicking on the image advance the user to the next image */
