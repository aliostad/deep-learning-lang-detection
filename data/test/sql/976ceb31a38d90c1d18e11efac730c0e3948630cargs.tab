  This is useful if the output should go to one of the input files.

  * If no files are specified, stdin is used for input, and stdout for output.
  * Warning: this has potential to consume large amounts of memory.

  NOTE: When redirecting output, your shell may open the target file for writing
        before the processes begin executing.  so using the '-o' option is safer
        than redirecting to a file.
